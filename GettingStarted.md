# You will need #

  * Python ( http://www.python.org )
  * An ODF-compatible word processor (e.g. http://www.openoffice.org )
  * The source (from the source tab, no downloads available yet)

# How to test #

  * Download the source into a folder.
  * From the command line type: `python odr_util.py`
  * Use your word processor to compare _door\_poc.odt_ and _door\_poc.out.odt_

If you want to try things yourself, edit the filename in odr\_util.py
