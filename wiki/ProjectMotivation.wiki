= Introduction =

I spend a lot of time working with .Net-compatible reporting tools such as Crystal Reports and SSRS. A lot of this time is spent on the following tasks: 

 * copying-and-pasting existing documents into the reporting framework
 * adding fields
 * making minor modifications (such as adding / removing sentences)
 * adding the same fields repeatedly (for example, addresses)
 * answering questions on why they can't do more ad-hoc reporting themselves

I don't believe I can solve all these problems, but with the right tools, it should be posible to let the users takes more responsibility and let the framework do more of the repetitive tasks. I started this project to see how far the tools and the framework could take us.
