= You will need =

 * Python ( http://www.python.org )
 * An ODF-compatible word processor (e.g. http://www.openoffice.org )
 * The source (from the source tab, no downloads available yet)

= How to test =

 * Download the source into a folder.
 * From the command line type: `python odr_util.py`
 * Use your word processor to compare _door_poc.odt_ and _door_poc.out.odt_

If you want to try things yourself, edit the filename in odr_util.py
