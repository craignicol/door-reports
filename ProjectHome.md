A (currently proof-of-concept) suite of tools for creating ODF documents from XML input using XSLT stylesheets. The technology exists, but I hope to create an API for developers and a GUI for business users so that users can generate their own templates for developers to drop into their project.

The code currently includes a Python toolkit for processing ODF files, and a partial re-implementation in IronPython, but the goal is that any language with support for ZIP and XSLT should be able to handle the heavy lifting.
